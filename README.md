## Coding

### Utils

- **`emshower.py`** - using DBSCAN + clustering methods to reconstruct shower directions and EM showers.
- **`showerrec.py`** - define segment class; count cylinder
- **`robustfit.py`** - robust fitting module

### Scripts

#### MC Studies

- **`truth_MC_study.ipynb`** â€“ Plot the variable distributions using the truth MC information
- **`dbscan_MC.ipynb`** - Study the DBSCAN Clustering Method on electron MC, and compare its performance with our old method.

#### Testbeam Data Studies

- **`data_preprocess.ipynb`** - Prepare the csv data file we need.
- **`testbeam_study.ipynb`** - Apply the cylinder & kinematic selections to testbeam data, and get the variable distributions.

#### Technique Demonstrations

- **`dbscan.ipynb`** - DBSCAN demonstration.
- **`hdbscan.ipynb`** - HDBSCAN demonstration.

### Data (*.csv)

#### **`data/testbeam`** - Testbeam data
- **`data/testbeam/select`** - Original scanned data with a basic preliminary cut `nseg>=3`
- **`data/testbeam/cylinder`** - testbeam data after cylinder selections. The segments and tracks in the same cylinder are regarded as the same event, and are assigned the same event ID.
- **`data/testbeam/shower`** - testbeam data shower information. Including important shower variables.

#### **`data/MC`** - MC data
- **`data/MC/select.csv`**: MC sample with a basic preliminary cut `nseg>=3``
- **`data/MC/axis_old.csv`**: axis information obtained by our "old method"
- **`data/MC/nue_truth.csv`**: truth information in nueCC 
- **`data/MC/cylinder_truth.csv`**: MC sample after the **truth** cylinder selection. Which means the cylinder axis is the truth primary electron direction recorded in nueCC samples.
- **`data/MC/shower_truth.csv`**: MC sample truth shower information after the **truth** cylinder selection. Including important shower variables.
